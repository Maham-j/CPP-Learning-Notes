# 🚀  Comments

This program demonstrates how to print text to the console and use comments in C++.



## 🔍 Explanation

### 1. **Printing Output:**
   - `cout << "Hello World" << endl;` – This prints "Hello World" and moves to the next line using `endl`.
   - `cout << "Next line";` – Prints "Next line" on the next line.

### 2. **Comments:**
   - **Single-line comment (`//`)**: Everything after `//` is ignored by the compiler, useful for short explanations.
   - **Multi-line comment (`/* ... */`)**: Used to comment out multiple lines at once. In this program, the second print section is commented out, so it doesn't run.
