### Explanation of Operators in the Code

1. **Arithmetic Operators**: 
   - `+` (Addition), `-` (Subtraction), `*` (Multiplication), `/` (Division), `%` (Modulus)
   - Used to perform basic math operations.

2. **Relational Operators**: 
   - `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
   - Used to compare two values and return boolean results.

3. **Logical Operators**: 
   - `&&` (Logical AND), `||` (Logical OR), `!` (Logical NOT)
   - Used to combine or negate boolean expressions.

4. **Assignment Operators**: 
   - `+=`, `-=`, etc.
   - Used to assign values to variables, often combined with operations.

5. **Increment and Decrement Operators**: 
   - `++` (Increment), `--` (Decrement)
   - Used to increase or decrease a variable's value by one.
