### While Loop Explanation

## ðŸš¦ While Loop
- **Purpose**: Repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
- **Initialization**: Start with a counter variable (e.g., `count`).
- **Condition**: Check if the counter meets the exit condition (e.g., `count <= 5`).
- **Output**: Executes the loop body, outputs the counter, and increments it.

## ðŸš¦ Do-While Loop
- **Purpose**: Similar to the while loop, but guarantees at least one execution of the loop body.
- **Initialization**: Start with a counter variable (e.g., `count`).
- **Execution**: Executes the loop body first, then checks the exit condition.
- **Output**: Outputs the counter and increments it until the condition fails.

## ðŸš¦ For Loop
- **Purpose**: A compact way to execute a block of code a specific number of times.
- **Initialization**: Initialize the counter (e.g., `int count = 1`).
- **Condition**: Specify the condition for continuation (e.g., `count <= 5`).
- **Increment**: Automatically increments the counter after each iteration.
- **Output**: Outputs the counter value during each loop iteration.
