### Why Do We Need Destructors? ðŸ¤”

1. **Automatic Object Destruction**:  
   - When an object goes out of scope (like when a function ends), it is destroyed automatically. However, if that object has allocated resources (like memory or file handles), those resources need to be released explicitly.

2. **Managing Resources**:  
   - Destructors ensure that any resources the object was using (e.g., dynamic memory, files, or network connections) are properly freed or closed. Without destructors, these resources would remain allocated, causing **memory leaks**.

3. **Preventing Resource Exhaustion**:  
   - If resources are not released, it can lead to resource exhaustion, making it impossible to allocate more memory or open more files, which can crash the program or slow it down.
