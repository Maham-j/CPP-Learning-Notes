#  1. **Shallow Copy** 

- **What it does**: Copies an object by copying its values, including pointers (just the memory addresses).
- **Problem**: If two objects share the same pointer, changes in one object affect the other. It can also lead to **errors** if one object deletes the memory, leaving the other pointing to nothing.

##### Example:
If two people have the same house key, if one person changes the locks, the other can’t use the key anymore.

#  2. **Deep Copy**

- **What it does**: Creates a full, independent copy of the object, including duplicating any memory it points to.
- **Benefit**: Changes in one object do not affect the other. Each object manages its own memory safely.

##### Example:
Each person gets their own house with their own key, so changes to one house don’t affect the other.

Shallow is faster but can cause issues, while deep is safer but slower.
