# Parametric Constructor üìã

- In C++, constructors are special functions that are only called once when an object is created. They are responsible for initializing the object's state (its data members).
-  After the object has been constructed, you cannot manually call the constructor again, because constructors are not regular member functions.

 ```cpp
   emp1.Employee("Jamil", 2000);  // INVALID, trying to call constructor again
 ```
- if you call this it will cause an error.
- If you want to modify the object‚Äôs data after creation, do so by directly assigning new values to the data members:
```cpp
emp1.name = "Jamil";   // Correct way to modify the name after creation
emp1.salary = 2000;    // Modify the salary
emp1.printDetails();   // Prints updated details
```

## Calling private member
- private members are accesed only inside class or subclass(inheritance)
- However,to access outside the class you have to create getter functions

```cpp
  // Function to get the secret code
        void getSecretCode() {
            cout << "The secret code is " << this->secretCode; // Access and print secret code
        }

emp1.getSecretCode();              // Print secret code
```

# Non-Parametric Constructor üèóÔ∏è
- **Definition**: A constructor that does not take any parameters.
- **Purpose**: Initializes an object with default values or does not require initial values.


### Key Differences ‚úîÔ∏è

| Feature                   | Parametric Constructor            | Non-Parametric Constructor         |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Parameters**            | Accepts parameters                 | Does not accept parameters          |
| **Initialization**        | Allows initialization with specific values | Initializes with default values  |
| **Use Case**              | Used when specific values are needed | Used when default or no values are sufficient |
