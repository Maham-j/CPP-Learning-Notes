### Inheritance in C++ üìö
- **Inheritance** allows a new class (derived class) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (base class).
- It promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

#### Syntax Example ‚úçÔ∏è
```cpp
class Base {
    // Base class members
};

class Derived : public Base {
    // Derived class members
};
```

#### Key Points ‚úîÔ∏è
- **Access Modifiers**: Use `public`, `protected`, or `private` to control access to base class members.
- **Constructor Initialization**: The derived class constructor can call the base class constructor.
- **Function Overriding**: Derived classes can override base class methods for specific functionality.
