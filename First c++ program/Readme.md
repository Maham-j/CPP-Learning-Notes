# 🚀 First C++ Program: Hello World!

Welcome to your first C++ program! 🎉 This simple program prints `Hello World` to the screen.



### 📝 Breakdown
- `#include <iostream>`: Loads the input/output library for console interaction. `<iostream>` is a preprocessor command that will do preprocessing of program before compiling.
- `using namespace std;`: Allows us to avoid writing `std::` before `cout`.
- `cout << "Hello World";`: Prints "Hello World" to the console.
- `return 0;`: Ends the program.
